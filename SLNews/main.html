    We are dedicated to bringing you information on the activities of the SLF.
    To inform you about the ugly world of closed source and to open your eyes 
    to the truth. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Every day millions upon millions of lines code are enslaved for abuse by 
    the system. Innocent code should not have to suffer like this.
    </p>
    <p>
    We know that this kind of mistreatment often leads to the code showing 
    odd behaviour. Code has been known to go into deadlock and even eternal 
    loops when they have been observed by Software Rights activists.

    <i>
    Sometimes I think that perhaps one of the best things I could do with 
    my life is: find a gigantic pile of proprietary software that was a 
    trade secret, and start handing out copies on a street corner so it 
    wouldn't be a trade secret any more.</i>

    <p>Said by Richard Stallman at KTH, Sweden in 1986.</p>
