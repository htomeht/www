  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <div class="page">
  <p>SLN is dedicated to telling the world about SLF.</p>
  <p>SLF is a group of people who have taken to arms against the oppression.
  SLF has no leadership, only a set of rules to which one must abide to consider  oneself a member.

  <p class="heavy">* To use only free software.<br />
  * To stop software oppression, illegaly if need be.<br />
  * To harm no person.<br />
  * To free software from emprisonment or <br />
  * To cause damage to property which is used to enslave software or<br />
  * To document the abuse of closed source.
  </p>
  <p>
  SLF activists fight for software freedom using direct action. 
  Trashing a proprietary company, Stealing documentation, liberating closed
  software. Burning down employe cars and breaking their windows. 
  All are methods employed by the SLF.
